# if I do ... and if I did ...

这个还算比较简单，常见的规则就一个

When we talk about something that will not happen, or we don’t expect that it will happen, we use if + past (if we went / if there was etc.).

> 你会做什么如果你赢了很多钱

- What would you do if you won a lot of money?

> 如果明天有个选举，你会选谁

- If there was an election tomorrow, who would you vote for

> 如果你在大街上找到了一个钱包，你会做什么？

- If you found a wallet in the street, what would you do with it?
