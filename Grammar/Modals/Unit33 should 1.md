# should 1

- when something is not right or what we expect
- we expect something to happen

should 比较重要的是 should have done 的用法。表示 you didn't do it, but it would have been a good thing to do:

> 你错过了一个很好的 party 昨晚。你应该来的。你为什么没来？

- You missed a great party last night. You should have come. Why didn't you?

否定则表示：you didn’t do it, but it would have been a good thing to do

> 我感到有点病，我不应该吃这么多

- I'm feelilng sick. I shouldn' have eaten so much

> 她不应该听我们的对话。那是私人的

- She shouldn't have been listening to our conversation. It was private

should 和 ought to 可以替换
