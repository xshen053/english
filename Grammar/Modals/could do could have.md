# 一文说明白 could

Unit26 讲了 could 可以作为 can 的 past，但其实还有另外一些情况用 could

## case1: possible actions now or in the future, 主要是 suggestions

> what shall we do tonight?

- we could go to the cinema (less sure)
- we can go the the cinema

> When you go to Paris next month,

- you could stay with Sarah.

## case2: actions not realistic

> 我太累了，我可以睡一周

- I am so tired, I could sleep for a week

> 这地方太好了。我可以一辈子呆在这里

- This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever.

## case3: something is possible now or in the future

区分一下 case1，case 1 是一些 action，而 case 3 更像是 fact

> 这个故事可能是真的，但我不认为是

- The story could be true, but I don't think it is.

> 我不知道 Lisa 什么时候来。她可能随时可以来

- I don't know what time Lisa is coming. She could get here any time.

> 天气现在不错，但是它可能之后就变了

- The weather is nice now, but it could change later.
