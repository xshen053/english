# 一文说明白 can, could 和 be able to

我们都知道 can 表达的是能够做什么。但很多时候，经常听到用 could 和 be able to。  
他们之间到底有什么区别？

> can: We use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something.

## present 时态

所以一般时都是用 can。在这层意思下，can 和 be able to 是可以交换的。唯一的区别：can 更 usual

example:

> 我们能够从我们的酒店看到那个湖

- We can see the lake from our hotel
- We are able to see the lake from our hotel

## past 时态

和 present 没有区别，只不过 can 变成了 could。同样可以和 be able to 交换

example

> 我当时坐在剧院的后面，不能听的很清楚

- I was sitting at the back of the theatre and couldn’t hear very well.
- I was sitting at the back of the theatre and was not able to hear very well.
