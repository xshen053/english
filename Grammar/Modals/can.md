# 一文说明白 can, could 和 be able to

我们都知道 can 表达的是能够做什么。但很多时候，经常听到用 could 和 be able to。  
他们之间到底有什么区别？

> can: We use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something.

## present 时态

所以一般时都是用 can。在这层意思下，can 和 be able to 是可以交换的。唯一的区别：can 更 usual

example:

> 我们能够从我们的酒店看到那个湖

- We can see the lake from our hotel
- We are able to see the lake from our hotel

## past 时态 1，可互换

和 present 没有区别，只不过 can 变成了 could。同样可以和 be able to 交换

example

> 我当时坐在剧院的后面，不能听的很清楚

- I was sitting at the back of the theatre and couldn’t hear very well.
- I was sitting at the back of the theatre and was not able to hear very well.

## past 时态 2，只能用 was / were able to

> could: 指 general ability

> be able to: to say that somebody succeeded in doing something in a specific situation, we normally use was/were able to or managed to (not could):
> example

> Jack 年轻的时候是一个杰出的网球玩家。他可以击败任何人

- Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He could beat anybody. (= he was good enough to beat anybody, he had the ability)
  > Jack 和 Andy 昨天比赛了。Andy 玩的很好，但是 Jack 还是想办法打败了他
- Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack managed to beat him. (= he succeeded in beating him this time)

## 其他时态 & can 的局限性

因为 can 只有 2 个形式：present 和 past。所以其他情况，我们只能用 be able to 了

example

> 我最近一直都没能好好睡觉

- 分析：现在完成时，所以无法用 can/could
- I haven't been able to sleep recently

> Tom 明天可以来

- 分析：可能的语气
- Tom might be able to come tomorrow
